# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Project Description:

This project introduces sorting algorithms and Big O notation in the C language.
Mandatory Task/Algorithms:
- Bubble sort

- Selection sort
- Quick sort (Using Lomuto partition scheme)

## Learning Objectives
- Four aforemention mandatory sorting algorithms and 9 optional Advanced Task algorithms.
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
